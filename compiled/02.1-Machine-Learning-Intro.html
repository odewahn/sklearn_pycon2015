<h1>About Scikit-Learn</h1>

<p><a href='http://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn'>Scikit-Learn</a> is a Python package designed to give access to <strong>well-known</strong> machine learning algorithms within Python code, through a <strong>clean, well-thought-out API</strong>. It has been built by hundreds of contributors from around the world, and is used across industry and academia.</p>
<p>Scikit-Learn is built upon Python's <a href='http://numpy.org'>NumPy (Numerical Python)</a> and <a href='http://scipy.org'>SciPy (Scientific Python)</a> libraries, which enable efficient in-core numerical and scientific computation within Python. As such, scikit-learn is not specifically designed for extremely large datasets, though there is <a href='https://github.com/ogrisel/parallel_ml_tutorial'>some work</a> in this area.</p>
<p>For this short introduction, I'm going to stick to questions of in-core processing of small to medium datasets with Scikit-learn.</p>

<h1>What is Machine Learning?</h1>

<p>In this section we will begin to explore the basic principles of machine learning.
Machine Learning is about building programs with <strong>tunable parameters</strong> (typically an
array of floating point values) that are adjusted automatically so as to improve
their behavior by <strong>adapting to previously seen data.</strong></p>
<p>Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> since those
algorithms can be seen as building blocks to make computers learn to behave more
intelligently by somehow <strong>generalizing</strong> rather that just storing and retrieving data items
like a database system would do.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at two very simple machine learning tasks here.
The first is a <strong>classification</strong> task: the figure shows a
collection of two-dimensional data, colored according to two different class
labels. A classification algorithm may be used to draw a dividing boundary
between the two clusters of points:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
%matplotlib inline

# set seaborn plot defaults.
# This can be safely commented out
import seaborn; seaborn.set()
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
# Import the example plot from the figures directory
from fig_code import plot_sgd_separator
plot_sgd_separator()
</pre>

<p>This may seem like a trivial task, but it is a simple version of a very important concept.
By drawing this separating line, we have learned a model which can <strong>generalize</strong> to new
data: if you were to drop another point onto the plane which is unlabeled, this algorithm
could now <strong>predict</strong> whether it's a blue or a red point.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the source code used to generate this, you can either open the
code in the <code>figures</code> directory, or you can load the code using the <code>%load</code> magic command:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
#Uncomment the %load command to load the contents of the file
# %load fig_code/sgd_separator.py
</pre>

<p>The next simple task we'll look at is a <strong>regression</strong> task: a simple best-fit line
to a set of data:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from fig_code import plot_linear_regression
plot_linear_regression()
</pre>

<p>Again, this is an example of fitting a model to data, such that the model can make
generalizations about new data.  The model has been <strong>learned</strong> from the training
data, and can be used to predict the result of test data:
here, we might be given an x-value, and the model would
allow us to predict the y value.  Again, this might seem like a trivial problem,
but it is a basic example of a type of operation that is fundamental to
machine learning tasks.</p>

<h1>Representation of Data in Scikit-learn</h1>

<p>Machine learning is about creating models from data: for that reason, we'll start by
discussing how data can be represented in order to be understood by the computer.  Along
with this, we'll build on our matplotlib examples from the previous section and show some
examples of how to visualize data.</p>
<p>Most machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn expect data to be stored in a
<strong>two-dimensional array or matrix</strong>.  The arrays can be
either <code>numpy</code> arrays, or in some cases <code>scipy.sparse</code> matrices.
The size of the array is expected to be <code>[n_samples, n_features]</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>n_samples:</strong>   The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g. classify).
A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, an astronomical object,
a row in database or CSV file,
or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.</li>
<li><strong>n_features:</strong>  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each
item in a quantitative manner.  Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or
discrete-valued in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional
(e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case
where <code>scipy.sparse</code> matrices can be useful, in that they are
much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays.</p>

<h1>A Simple Example: the Iris Dataset</h1>

<p>As an example of a simple dataset, we're going to take a look at the
iris data stored by scikit-learn.
The data consists of measurements of three different species of irises.
There are three species of iris in the dataset, which we can picture here:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from IPython.core.display import Image, display
display(Image(filename='images/iris_setosa.jpg'))
print("Iris Setosa\n")

display(Image(filename='images/iris_versicolor.jpg'))
print("Iris Versicolor\n")

display(Image(filename='images/iris_virginica.jpg'))
print("Iris Virginica")
</pre>

<section data-type='sect2'>
<h2>Quick Question:</h2>

<p><strong>If we want to design an algorithm to recognize iris species, what might the data be?</strong></p>
<p>Remember: we need a 2D array of size <code>[n_samples x n_features]</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What would the <code>n_samples</code> refer to?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What might the <code>n_features</code> refer to?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that there must be a <strong>fixed</strong> number of features for each sample, and feature
number <code>i</code> must be a similar kind of quantity for each sample.</p>
</section>
<section data-type='sect2'>
<h2>Loading the Iris Data with Scikit-Learn</h2>

<p>Scikit-learn has a very straightforward set of data on these iris species.  The data consist of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Features in the Iris dataset:</p>
<ol>
<li>sepal length in cm</li>
<li>sepal width in cm</li>
<li>petal length in cm</li>
<li>petal width in cm</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Target classes to predict:</p>
<ol>
<li>Iris Setosa</li>
<li>Iris Versicolour</li>
<li>Iris Virginica</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>scikit-learn</code> embeds a copy of the iris CSV file along with a helper function to load it into numpy arrays:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris()
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
iris.keys()
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
n_samples, n_features = iris.data.shape
print((n_samples, n_features))
print(iris.data[0])
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
print(iris.data.shape)
print(iris.target.shape)
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
print(iris.target)
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
print(iris.target_names)
</pre>

<p>This data is four dimensional, but we can visualize two of the dimensions
at a time using a simple scatter-plot:</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x_index = 0
y_index = 1

# this formatter will label the colorbar with the correct target names
formatter = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda i, *args: iris.target_names[int(i)])

plt.scatter(iris.data[:, x_index], iris.data[:, y_index],
            c=iris.target, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('RdYlBu', 3))
plt.colorbar(ticks=[0, 1, 2], format=formatter)
plt.clim(-0.5, 2.5)
plt.xlabel(iris.feature_names[x_index])
plt.ylabel(iris.feature_names[y_index]);
</pre>

<h2>Quick Exercise:</h2>

<p><strong>Change</strong> <code>x_index</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>y_index</code> <strong>in the above script
and find a combination of two parameters
which maximally separate the three classes.</strong></p>
<p>This exercise is a preview of <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong>, which we'll see later.</p>

<h1>Other Available Data</h1>

<p>They come in three flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Packaged Data:</strong> these small datasets are packaged with the scikit-learn installation,
and can be downloaded using the tools in <code>sklearn.datasets.load_*</code></li>
<li><strong>Downloadable Data:</strong> these larger datasets are available for download, and scikit-learn
includes tools which streamline this process.  These tools can be found in
<code>sklearn.datasets.fetch_*</code></li>
<li><strong>Generated Data:</strong> there are several datasets which are generated from models based on a
random seed.  These are available in the <code>sklearn.datasets.make_*</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can explore the available dataset loaders, fetchers, and generators using IPython's
tab-completion functionality.  After importing the <code>datasets</code> submodule from <code>sklearn</code>,
type</p>
<pre data-type='programlisting'>datasets.load_ + TAB</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre data-type='programlisting'>datasets.fetch_ + TAB</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre data-type='programlisting'>datasets.make_ + TAB</pre>
<p>to see a list of available functions.</p>
<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
from sklearn import datasets
</pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
# Type datasets.fetch_<tab> or datasets.load_<tab> in IPython to see all possibilities

datasets.fetch_lfw_people
</tab></tab></pre>

<pre data-code-language='python' data-executable='true' data-type='programlisting'>
# datasets.load_
</pre>

<p>In the next section, we'll use some of these datasets and take a look at the basic principles of machine learning.</p>
